# PIG â€“ Procedural Image Generator


## Background 

This project aims to provide easy and fun way to generate procedural 2D graphics similar to Blenders node editor. The starting goal was to design a tool specifically to generate prints for paper airplanes. You can use this app to generate all sorts of things though!

## Project structure

The project structure is pretty straight forward: frontend is implemented with Next.js and backend with Python/Flask.

## Current status

Currently, you can generate random noise with the node editor, but other types of noise and better pipeline is coming soon (tm).
